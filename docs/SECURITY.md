# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our project is a top priority. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your cooperation in responsibly investigating and reporting it to us so we can address it as quickly as possible.

Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Do not report security vulnerabilities in public places, such as GitHub issues or Discord.**
2. Email the project maintainers directly at [nishiki.tech@gmail.com](mailto:nishiki.tech@gmail.com).
3. Include as much information as possible in your report, such as:
   - The type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any steps to reproduce the issue or proof-of-concept
4. After initial contact, we may work closely with you to understand the issue and ensure that we address the security concern swiftly.
5. We request that you give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any public disclosure, in accordance with the principle of responsible disclosure.

## Security Updates

We will release detailed security announcements when we fix a security vulnerability. This will include information about the impact of the vulnerability and the conditions required for it to be exploited.

Thank you for helping to keep our project and its users secure.
